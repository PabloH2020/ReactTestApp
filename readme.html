<h1>Thank you for applying to TNT Dental as a Front-end Developer. </h1>

<p>In this folder there is a photoshop and jpg design file, both identical, of a landing page, a basic starter site template, and all the images needed in the folder site/assets/images. The text for the landing page is copied below. Using the design file as reference, develop the landing page with HTML and CSS as closely as possible and making it mobile reponsive. You can use the code editor of your choice, and style with CSS or Sass. To set up the reviews slider you can use a slider script. The one we most commonly use is Slick Slider.  <a href="https://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/">https://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/</a></p>
